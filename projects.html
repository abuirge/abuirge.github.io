    <h2>Hug the Angry Jarvis Game in CISC 230 at UST:</h2>

    <p>During my Sophomore year at UST, I took CISC 230 with Professor Sawin. Our final project for the class was to create a simple game with the goal being to move your "player" to find "Jarvis" & hug him to calm him down. 
        In this project I used HashMap, ArrayList, Strings, Scanner, & other basic Java constructs. Additionally, the game was designed with interfaces, nested classes & included dealing with exceptions & working with multiple Threads.
        I enjoyed this project specifically because it was something that I could show others & actually have them interact with.

    <h2>US Energy Consumption Dynamic Web Server in CISC 375 at UST:</h2>
    <img src="" alt="Energy Image" width="100">
    <p>During my Junior year at UST, I took CISC 375 with Professor Marrinan. A group project for the class was to create a dynamic web server about US energy consumption from 1960 to 2018. 
        In this project I used CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. We developed dynamic routes for pages on energy consumption for a particular year, energy consumption for a particular state, and energy consumption for a particular energy source.
        I enjoyed this project specifically because it was something that I could show others & actually have them interact with.

    <h2>Reflection Document for the UST Laudato Sí Action Plan in THEO 459 at UST:</h2>
    <img src="" alt="LS Image" width="100">
    <p>During my Senior year at UST, I took THEO 459 with Professors Anthony & Hickson. 
        The group project for the class was to create a Reflection section for the University of Saint Thomas's Laudato Sí Action Plan, making clear how St. Thomas's values and mission connects with Laudato Sí.
        This project required that I became very familiar with the University's Sustainability Initiatives. 
        It involved interviewing key people on sustainability initiatives at UST and developing a deep understanding of what UST is doing and where it can improve. 
        Finally, it required that I understand the connections between Laudato Sí UST's activities, in order to develop a reasoned and measured reflection.

    <h2>Summer 2019, Windows 7 to Windows 10 Move at Egan Company:</h2>
    <img src="7to10.jpg" alt="Windows 7 to Windows 10" width="250">
    <p>During my second internship summer at Egan Company, our main project as interns was to coordinate with office employees & complete the migration process from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
        The main challenge was that the company uses VMware & thus Virtual Machines for their users. When we arrived on day 1, the IT department was in the early stages of setting up the Windows 10 virtual envrionment, this allowed for us to get hand on experience with the various processes involved with installing applications to be used across the company.
        The largest obsticle was solving the issues that resulted from the Virtual Machines being "instant clones", this meant that each user did not have a permanent VM. At log-in, the users credendials are used to access their specific data on our local servers & is mounted to a clone of the "gold image" machine.
        This resulted in sometimes applications not saving settings or even sometimes not working whatsoever. These issues required many hours of troubleshooting & support calls with VMware. Examples for fixes were to edit the registry or create group policy objects (GPO's).

    <h2>Summer 2018, Local Storage to Google Drive File Stream at Egan Company:</h2>
    <img src="gdfs.jpg" alt="Google Drive File Stream" width="250">
    <p>During my first internship summer at Egan Company, our main project was to coordinate with office employees & complete migration of their local data over to Google Drive File Stream.
        This allowed the company to free up a lot of local resources, of which were beginning to reach capacity. The main obsticle of this project were the few employees who had >100GB of files stored locally.
        When we first attempted to do a move of this size the estimated completion time for the transfer was over 3 days which would not work because the employee still had to do work. This resulted in having to coordinate with the user to only use certain folders (local & GDFS) as their changes could be lost due to migration time in relation to when they were editing the document.
        This issue was mostly overcome by scheduling these very large moves over the weekends & using a laptop instead of our VM to do the file transfer.
