    <h2>About Me: </h2>
    <p>I am a Junior at the University of St. Thomas currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with Double Minor in Data Analytics & Statistics.
        Goals for after graduation are to work as a Data Scientist preferably for a company involved in renewable energy. I am also interested in Machine Learning & Robotics Process Automation.
        Lastly, I hope to make a difference in the communities I find myself in by frequently volunteering in ways such as Feed My Starving Children.
