    <p>&emsp;During my Sophomore year at UST, I took CISC 230 with Professor Sawin. Our final project for the class was to create a simple game with the goal being to move your "player" to find "Jarvis" & hug him to calm him down. 
        In this project I used HashMap, ArrayList, Strings, Scanner, & other basic Java constructs. Additionally, the game was designed with interfaces, nested classes & included dealing with exceptions & working with multiple Threads.
        I enjoyed this project specifically because it was something that I could show others & actually have them interact with.
